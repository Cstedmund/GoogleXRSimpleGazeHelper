# GoogleXRSimpleGazeHelper
 
This Google XR Simple Gaze Helper is just for Unity only.
Since unity 2020, Google GVR is replaced by the Google XR package. A lot of functions were removed, including the VR camera gaze.

This project provides a simple solution to bring back the gaze pointer with the hover trigger function without using XRIT.

You can download the repository open it by unity and study the code.

The gaze is work fine under URP and Unity 2020 LTS
This Sample project is modified from the google XR package sample project: https://github.com/googlevr/cardboard-xr-plugin.git
- CameraPointer.cs Script modified only

The Basic concept of this project is putting all objects you want to interact with the camera pointer into a single layer. Then the camera can detect the object and perform the interaction.

A more detailed tutorial will be updated later.

This project is still in work.
